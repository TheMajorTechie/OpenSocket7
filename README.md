# OpenSocket7
Community-created Design files for Socket 7/Super Socket 7

Because for whatever reason, I've decided this is my current obsession-project thing. All files are under GPL3. Have at it ya madlads.

End goal: Make a Powerleap-style CPU adapter interposer complete with VRMs and multiplier jumpers.
